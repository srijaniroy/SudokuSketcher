We can change waiting time and resolution using this file

#How long should the waiting time between tries be in milliseconds.
#If set to 0 it will solve as fast as possible.
#If set to 1000 it will wait 1 second for each move
sleepTimeBetweenMoves = 0

#Resolution
#Width will be equal to height so only one of them has to be set
#On a 1080 screen, around 700 is a good number
resolution = 500
